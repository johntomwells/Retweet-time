# Retweet-time

Tweets of fast food joints, celebrities, cats, news organizations, with time stamps and retweet count.

jungle.xlsx is the raw stuff downloaded using a mildly modified version of Yanofsky's tweet_dumper.py, found [here](https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496)

cleaner.py reads the excel file, removes outliers, rewrites only timestamps and retweet count to new csv file.

cleanboys.csv is that file
